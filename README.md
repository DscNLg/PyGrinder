Hey!
This is NOT under active development since the bot is introducing breaking changes every other day.
Waiting for dank memer v10 seems like the best move to me right now, hence;

It's goal is to show how stuff can be automated on discord, and interact and play a game bot- Dank Memer
It is not my current project hence progress will be slow.

It previously used the discord.py lib, but I will not be able to scale using that- hence I am now shifting it to requests.
(Yes it does not have a main file just yet, still working on the backend)

## TODO:

This project was heavily inspired by [this one](https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder) and hopes to achieve at least what the original program has done.
I.E. shifts, instances, config etc

This should also support more functions such as daily, weekly, monthly etc, as well as be compatible with new updates.
(also alot for my own experience so yes)

## config structures would like like this?

#### \_crime_mode:

    0: Preference from list, if not, random
    1: Preference from list, if not, cancel
    2: Random
